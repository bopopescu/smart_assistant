Occidental Petroleumâ€™s profits from oil and gas business dropped by 4% in Q4-2018 which was a tough period for oil producers.

However, Occidental Petroleum exhibited its ability to generate strong levels of operating cash flows in 4Q18 which fully funded the CapEx and nearly all of the dividends.

Occidental Petroleum has slashed its capital budget for 2019 by 10% which puts it in a good position to continue generating enough cash flows to fully fund CapEx and dividends.

With a flexible capital budget and a strong balance sheet, Occidental Petroleum can sustain dividends even if oil prices turn out weaker than expected.
